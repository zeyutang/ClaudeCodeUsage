# Changelog

All notable changes to this fork compared to upstream
[`ClaudeCodeUsage/ClaudeCodeUsage`](https://github.com/ClaudeCodeUsage/ClaudeCodeUsage) (last
upstream release: 1.0.8). Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Per-model weekly limits are read again** — Anthropic's usage API stopped
  filling in its per-model quota fields, so the weekly Opus figure had silently
  gone blank. The extension now reads whichever per-model weekly cap your plan
  meters and labels it the way Anthropic does, for example "Fable".
- **The quota tooltip follows the reset countdown format** — it always used
  whole units, so on the default decimal setting the same window read "4.5h" in
  the status bar but "4h 29m" in the tooltip. Every row now reads "time left
  (wall clock)" on one line, the 5-hour window included, which previously showed
  no reset time at all.
- **Missing settings translations** — four Brazilian Portuguese entries and one
  Indonesian entry showed English text in the settings panel.

### Added
- **Usage credits in the quota tooltip** — the amount spent this month against
  your cap, and the date it resets, once you have actually spent some. The figure
  stays visible after you switch credits off, since the spend already happened,
  and it copes with a cap you have raised, lowered, or removed entirely.

### Changed
- **`showOpusWeekly` is now `showScopedWeekly`** — the setting no longer names a
  single model, because the API says which model is capped. Your existing choice
  carries over, and it stays opt-in and off by default.
- **The quota tooltip lists every weekly cap** the API reports, each on its own
  row with its own bar, whether or not the status bar is showing it. A per-model
  cap can be the binding one, so it is always one hover away.
- **The status bar nests a per-model cap in the weekly figure** — "wk 9%
  (fable 17%)" with one countdown, rather than repeating the identical reset for
  each cap. A cap that reset on its own schedule would still get its own segment.
- **Caps with nothing to report stay hidden** — a per-model weekly cap appears
  once it has usage against it, so it is absent at the start of a week rather
  than sitting at 0%. The 5-hour and all-models figures always show.
- **Reset times read to the minute** — they were shown truncated to the second,
  so a cap resetting at 16:59:59 displayed as "16:59" while the cap it resets
  alongside displayed "17:00".

## [2.2.2] — Unreleased

### Fixed
- **Lower multi-window energy use** — Suspend polling and file watchers in
  unfocused VS Code windows, then refresh immediately when the window regains
  focus. This avoids repeating the same local scan in every Extension Host.
- **Quota failure throttling** — Back off repeated quota authentication failures
  for up to one hour, while retrying immediately after Claude credentials
  change.
- **Usage dashboard recovery (#79, fixes #82)** — one oversized non-transcript
  `.jsonl` can no longer abort the earliest-timestamp probe and blank the whole
  dashboard. Thanks [@ptweezy](https://github.com/ptweezy).
- **Opus 5 context window (#81, reported in #84)** — recognise the bare
  `claude-opus-5` model id as a 1M-context model and remove its spurious
  unknown-model pricing diagnostic. Thanks [@e7d](https://github.com/e7d).

## [2.2.1] — 2026-07-18

### Added
- **Bahasa Indonesia (`id`) (#76)** — the extension's eighth UI language covers
  the dashboard, status bar, settings, and AI-advice demo, with a dedicated
  `README-id.md`. Thanks [@projectronic](https://github.com/projectronic).
- **Sessions: all sessions + filters (#73)** — the Sessions tab can show all
  sessions and adds persisted time-range, project, and model filters. Thanks
  [@Carl723000](https://github.com/Carl723000).
- **Reset countdown formats (#75, closes #74)** — quota reset countdowns can use
  decimal, whole-unit, or local clock/date formats. Thanks
  [@projectronic](https://github.com/projectronic).
- **Indonesian timezone presets (#77)** — the timezone picker now includes WIB,
  WITA, and WIT presets. Thanks [@projectronic](https://github.com/projectronic).

### Changed
- **Codex maintenance handoff** — `AGENTS.md` is now the canonical repository
  policy with a Simplified-Chinese review copy. Claude Code and OpenAI Codex
  are credited as development tools, separately from human contributors.

### Fixed
- **High-CPU refresh mitigation (#70)** — polling now always honors the
  configured 30–3600 second `refreshInterval`; file watching is quiet-debounce
  only and adds 60/120/300-second choices. First-timestamp reads stop after the
  first valid timestamp and run with at most eight readers.
- **Date labels (#54, PR #71)** — daily rows on the first of a month remain
  daily labels, while monthly keys no longer shift one month backward in
  negative-UTC zones. Thanks [@YuboZhang](https://github.com/YuboZhang).
- **Automatic first-pass language (#72)** — repository bot replies now default
  to English, using English-first bilingual output only for Chinese authors.
- **Cold-start refresh failures** — an incomplete first scan now clears the
  loading state and shows a localized retry/diagnostic message while preserving
  an existing successful snapshot on later transient failures.

### Diagnostics
- **Anonymous refresh timings** — Show Diagnostic Logs now reports trigger,
  file/change/reuse/removal counts, bytes, parsed lines, watcher/coalescing
  counts, and manifest/read-parse/aggregate-render/total timings. It never logs
  prompts, paths, session IDs, credentials, or raw JSONL lines.

> This is a mitigation pending Linux prerelease validation. Issue #70 remains
> open until the reporter confirms the result; the per-file incremental index
> is tracked separately.

### Security
- Hardened GitHub first-pass automation with truthful per-tier provider attribution,
  one code-owned footer, fail-closed PR diff handling, and bounded base-repository file reads
  with traversal, symlink, hidden-path, and secret-path denial.
- Manual publish retries now require an explicit existing release tag, check out
  and verify its fully qualified `refs/tags/` commit, and can target only the
  registry that needs recovery.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-07-07

### Added
- **`tokenDecimalPlaces`** (default 1, 0–2) — decimals for the *compact* token
  display (`1.2M` / `345.6K`); full integer counts are unaffected.
- **Cache-hit-rate column** in the All-time (monthly) and This-month (daily)
  breakdown tables — and in the expanded per-day / per-hour drill-downs — so the
  cache efficiency is visible per row, not just in the summary card.
- **Token heatmap on the All tab** (opt-in, `showHeatmap`, default off) — a
  GitHub-style yearly token heatmap (Claude orange) at the top of the All tab.
  Inline SVG, so the per-day hover tooltips work in the dashboard. Mainly a
  shareable view of data already shown elsewhere, hence off by default.
- **Export Token Heatmap (GitHub style)** — a command that writes a
  self-contained, GitHub-contribution-style SVG of the trailing year's token
  usage (Claude-orange scale, top-left summary, per-day tooltips, source
  watermark) to a file, with a one-click "copy Markdown embed" — for pasting
  into a GitHub profile README. Pure, unit-tested renderer (`heatmapSvg.ts`).
- **Token-composition drill-down** — clicking a month in the All-time *Token
  composition* chart expands that month's per-day composition (alongside the
  daily chart + table), so you can read the input / output / cache-write /
  cache-read split day by day, not just at the month level.
- **Share-card + heatmap foundations** — tested pure logic (`src/shareCard.ts`,
  `src/heatmap.ts`) for the upcoming Usage Share Card and Monthly token heatmap.

- **Efficiency insights** (opt-in, `showEfficiency`, default off) — starts with a
  **top-10 costliest conversations** panel on the Content tab: expandable rows
  (native disclosure) showing each session's tokens, cache-hit rate, top model
  and project, ranked by cost. (Cost-per-message + realised cache-savings chips
  on Today/projects use the same toggle.)
- **"What's new" prompt after upgrades** — a single, dismissible notification
  the first time you run a new major.minor version, pointing at the dashboard so
  new (including opt-in, default-off) features are discoverable. Shown once per
  version; skipped on a fresh install.
- **Usage Share Card** (opt-in, `enableShareCard`, default off) — a configurable
  one-page SVG you can generate and export/share: pick a range (last 30 days /
  week / month / year / a specific month), a scope (overall / a project / a
  session), which metrics to show, and a **theme** — **Claude Classic** (orange,
  default), **Claude Cream**, **Aurora Dark**, or **Auto**. Self-contained SVG;
  optional GitHub **avatar + name**; deterministic; privacy by construction (no
  prompts/paths/ids). Built on demand; config + preview survive a refresh.
- **Publish Token Heatmap to GitHub** — one-click publish of the heatmap SVG to
  a repo (default: your profile repo) via VS Code's built-in GitHub auth (no
  PAT). Shows a consent modal first.
- **Top-10 costliest *messages*** (opt-in, `showCostliestMessages`, default off,
  Content tab) — ranks single turns by cost; expand for the triggering prompt,
  model, skill, a **cost split** that distinguishes a **cache miss** from a long
  answer, the **cache-hit rate**, and the **time since the last turn** (+ a
  "model switch flushed the cache" / "idle past cache TTL" cause). (Reworked from
  the earlier costliest-*conversations* panel.)
- **Cache warmth estimate** (`showEfficiency`) — infers how long your prompt
  cache stays warm while idle from your own turns (measured **~60 min**, not 5).
- **Efficiency chips** — cost/message, **tokens/message**, realised cache savings
  on Today / month / all-time; a **Cost/msg** column in the projects table.
- **Conversation viewer** (opt-in, `showConversationViewer`, **default on** — it's
  read-only) — a "view" button on the Sessions tab opens a read-only reader for a
  past conversation: your prompts up front, the model's answers rendered from
  Markdown (tables included), with thinking and tool traffic behind toggles. Lets
  you re-read a session to jog your memory *without* loading it back into the
  model's context (unlike resume). Reads local logs only; refreshes each time you
  open it; loads the last 10 rounds.
- **Experimental insights** (opt-in, `showInsights`, default off, Content tab) —
  heuristic estimates from your local logs, labelled as estimates: a **cache-churn
  bill** ($ spent re-writing cache after model switches / idle gaps), **cache
  warmth by model** (how long each model keeps your cache warm), **big one-shot
  turns** (a checkpoint nudge), **your active hours** (a 24-h token sparkline +
  peak window), and **skill ROI** (output tokens returned per $ per skill/plugin).
- **Sessions "Active" column** — estimated hands-on time per session (gaps between
  turns, each idle gap capped at 1.5 h), which is far more meaningful than the raw
  first-to-last span for long-lived sessions. Sortable, with an explanatory tooltip.
- **Live-refresh delay control** (`fileWatchSeconds`: Off / 1 / 2 / 5 / 10 / 20 /
  30 s, default 2 s) replaces the on/off "live file watching" toggle. This only
  re-reads your **local** log files — no API call; the `/usage` quota fetch is
  throttled separately.
- **Chinese share-card units** — the share card uses 万/亿 (萬/億 in zh-TW) and its
  text follows the UI language, so an English card is fully English and a Chinese
  card fully Chinese.

### Changed
- **`enableSessionActions`** (default off) gates the Sessions **resume _and_
  delete** buttons together — both *act* on your Claude Code (reopen / trash a
  log), at odds with the extension being read-only, so they're opt-in as a pair.
  (Replaces the earlier `enableSessionDelete`.)
- **Timezone-aware bucketing** — every Today / day / month / hour total now derives
  its day boundary from the configured IANA zone (empty = system), kept in lockstep
  with the display, so the aggregations agree with each other and with the console;
  an invalid zone falls back to the system zone instead of breaking the dashboard.
- **Cache-write cost by TTL** — when a log carries the cache-creation TTL split, a
  1-hour cache write is priced at 2× base input (vs the 5-minute 1.25×), matching
  Anthropic's billing; logs without the split are unchanged. (PR #62, @zeyutang.)
- **Timezone dropdown = full UTC-offset coverage** — common zones plus every UTC
  offset (grouped Common / UTC offset), each labelled with its current offset;
  IANA identifiers only (no editorialised place names).
- **`dashboardAutoRefresh`** (positive wording, default true) replaces the
  double-negative `pauseDashboardRefresh`; existing values are migrated.
- Repository metadata (`repository` / `bugs` / `homepage`) now points at the
  `ClaudeCodeUsage` organization.

### Fixed
- **Thinking share reads "hidden", not a false 0%,** for models that omit their
  reasoning text (Fable 5 / Opus 4.8 — `"thinking":""` + a signature).
- **Quota reset countdown** in the tooltip now reads `4d 12h` (the compact
  status-bar form keeps `4.5d`); a recently-expired usage-anchored window no
  longer shows a fabricated countdown while idle.
- **Auto-refresh no longer wipes** the generated share card or collapses expanded
  Content rows (reset only on tab switch); the GitHub avatar renders (webview CSP
  now allows `data:` images).
- Message counts exclude api_error retries and the compaction summary line.
- **Timezone is a validated dropdown** — the Timezone setting is now a picker of
  valid IANA zones (`Intl.supportedValuesOf`) instead of free text, so an invalid
  value can't be entered; a guard also rejects any old bad synced value. Fixes a
  crash where a hand-typed zone made `Intl` throw and broke the whole dashboard.
  (#51)
- **German (de-DE) now selectable** — the German translation (contributed by
  @mxzinke) existed in the strings and `SupportedLanguage` but had never been
  added to the `package.json` enum or the settings dropdown, so it couldn't be
  chosen. Exposed it everywhere; verified the translation and fixed two English
  leaks (`error`, popup `currentSession`).
- **pt-BR now selectable** — Brazilian Portuguese (added in 2.1.1) was missing
  from the dashboard's language dropdown (`settings.ts` enum) and the README
  language lists, even though the strings, `package.json` enum and
  `SupportedLanguage` already had it. Wired it through everywhere.
- **Timezone-correct month / day bucketing** — the This-month and All-time
  breakdowns now bucket every record's day *and* month in the configured
  timezone (empty = system). Previously the month boundary was local while the
  day key was UTC, so a record just after local midnight on the 1st showed up
  under the previous month's last day. (`src/dateKeys.ts`, unit-tested.)
- **Breakdown table scroll** — number cells stay on one line, so the compact
  (k/M) view fits the panel with no horizontal scroll while full integer numbers
  overflow and scroll the table only; the chart keeps its own scroll.
- **API-error retries no longer inflate the Messages count** — when a request
  errors, Claude Code retries it and re-logs the same user prompt; an identical
  prompt re-appearing within a short window is now counted once (genuine
  re-sends minutes/hours later still count). (`src/promptDedup.ts`, unit-tested.)
- **Compaction summary no longer counts as a message** — when a session is
  auto-compacted, Claude Code injects the "This session is being continued…"
  summary as a *user* message; it's now excluded from the Messages count (you
  never typed it). Verified on real logs.
- **Cache-write ("input cache miss") bars render again** — in every usage bar
  chart, selecting the cache-write metric showed only the axis and value labels:
  the bar's gradient referenced a `--vscode-charts-pink` colour VS Code doesn't
  define, which made the whole gradient invalid (transparent). Added a fallback.

### Removed
- Dropped the unused `@types/glob` devDependency (clears a vulnerability
  advisory). Thanks @zeyutang (#63).

### Fixed
- **Sonnet 5 context window** — `contextWindowFor()` only recognised the 1M
  window via a "4.6+" pattern (e.g. `sonnet-4-6`), so `claude-sonnet-5` — which
  has no `-4-` segment — fell through to the 200K legacy default. The dashboard
  and status-bar context bar now correctly show a 1M window for Sonnet 5.

## [2.1.1] — Unreleased

### Added
- **Monthly cost in the status bar** — the `statusBarMetric` setting gains a
  new `monthly-cost` option. When selected, the first status-bar item shows the
  current calendar month's total cost ($(calendar) icon) instead of today's
  cost. Hover tooltip mirrors the today tooltip with month-to-date token and
  cost breakdown. (PR #41, @PhisicsLollo0.)
- **Sessions: resume / copy / delete** — each session row can copy its id, copy
  its project path, resume it (in the
  official Claude Code extension, or a terminal for cross-project sessions), or
  delete it (to the trash, after a confirm); plus a Current project / All filter.
  (PR #43, @oxsean.)
- **Quota display options** — `quotaFiveHourOnly` (show only the 5-hour window)
  and `showResetInStatusBar` (append a compact reset countdown) in the ⚙ Settings
  tab. The default stays the clean `5h 6% · wk 1%`; full reset times always live
  in the tooltip. To hide cost, set `statusBarMetric` to `tokens`. (PR #43.)
- **Sturdier quota** — the last `/usage` result is cached to disk and shown
  instantly on startup; on a 429 the fetch backs off instead of hammering the
  endpoint. (PR #43.)
- **Wider dashboard** (up to 1600 px) with indented sub-project rows; status-bar
  setting changes apply without a full dashboard reload. (PR #43.)
- **Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR)** — adds pt-BR as a seventh interface
  language: status bar, dashboard, settings labels/help and the advice demo
  sample. (PR #48, @henrique-carvalho-dev.)

### Fixed
- **Account switch now refreshes the quota** — switching Claude accounts no
  longer leaves the status bar stuck on the previous account's usage until a
  window reload. The OAuth credentials are re-read on every quota fetch (a
  switched-in account's token is valid, so the old expiry-only re-read never
  noticed it), and the credentials file is watched so the change is picked up
  promptly instead of after a full cache interval. (Keychain-stored credentials
  on macOS update on the next refresh tick.) (PR #47.)
- **Model pricing accuracy** — several models had missing or stale pricing:
  `glm-5.1`, `glm-5.2` (were falling back to glm-4.6 rates), `minimax-m3`
  (used Sonnet default), `mimo-v2.5-pro` (used Sonnet default),
  `kimi-k2.7-code` (input/output correct via family inference, cache wrong),
  `qwen3.5-flash`, `qwen3.5-plus` (used qwen-plus rates),
  `hy3-preview` (used Sonnet default), `step-3.7-flash`, `step-3.5-flash`
  (used Sonnet default). Added correct official/exchange rates for each;
  registered family-inference branches for minimax, mimo, hy3 and step-
  so unknown future models from these providers also get sensible defaults.
  (PR #46, @YuboZhang.)

## [2.1.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added
- **Weekly Opus limit in the status bar** — opt-in `showOpusWeekly` (default
  off) appends `opus:NN%` after the 5h / weekly quota figures, for heavy Opus
  users who want an at-a-glance weekly Opus signal. Merged from
  [PR #38](https://github.com/ClaudeCodeUsage/ClaudeCodeUsage/pull/38)
  (@wheelbarrel00); re-applied here on the dashboard-managed settings.
- **Settings in the dashboard** — a new ⚙ Settings tab edits every option in
  place (grouped: General, Status bar, Data & refresh, AI advice & Optimizer),
  applied immediately. To keep VS Code's own Settings UI uncluttered, only
  three settings stay declared there (so they still sync via Settings Sync):
  `language`, `dataDirectory`, `advice.apiKey`. The rest now live in the
  extension's own storage and are managed from the dashboard. A one-time
  migration copies any existing `settings.json` values into the new store on
  first launch, so upgrades keep your configuration. (Setting labels/help are
  English; group headers and chrome are localised in all six languages.)
- **Workflows tab** — one row per multi-agent run: true dynamic-workflow
  runs (wf_ dirs) **and ad-hoc sub-agent batches** (≥2 Task-tool agents in
  one session, tagged "subagents" — what ultracode produces when the
  dynamic-workflow feature isn't engaged, e.g. via proxy routing). Columns:
  start time, name (script-derived or session title), project, **models
  used**, agent count, cost, token split, **cache hit rate** and duration;
  expands to a per-agent breakdown where each agent is labelled by **the
  task it was dispatched** (shared boilerplate hoisted into one pinned row,
  agent rows show only what differs; full text in tooltips). The cache
  hit rate is the headline diagnostic: native-Claude workflows reuse the
  prompt cache across agents (observed ~75%), a provider without cross-agent
  caching shows ~0% — i.e. the same workflow costs disproportionately more.
  A summary strip shows this month's workflow count, cost and cost share.
- **Sub-agent attribution in the loader** — records from `subagents/` logs
  now carry the workflow id, agent id and agent type (from
  `agent-*.meta.json`), resolved from the file path so worktree-isolated
  agents attribute correctly.
- **Thinking share** — estimated thinking-token share per session (new
  sortable Sessions column, ⚠ + `/effort` hint above 60%) and a one-line
  summary on the Today tab. Estimated from text length, like the rest of
  the content analysis.
- **Workflow quota guard** — a dismissible dashboard banner when the
  remaining 5-hour quota drops below `workflowQuotaWarnPercent` (default
  50%, 0 disables): interrupted workflow runs lose their prompt cache and
  re-run ~40% more expensive. The status bar stays untouched.
- **Usage attribution panel** ("What's contributing to your usage?") —
  modelled on the official `/usage` screen but multi-provider and with five
  scopes (Day / Week / Month / per-session / per-project, vs. Day/Week
  officially). Characteristic lines (independent signals, not a breakdown):
  share of usage at >150k context, from 8h+ active sessions, from
  subagent-heavy sessions, from workflow runs, plus the top skill and top
  plugin once they exceed 10%. Tables: Skills, Subagents (by agent type),
  Plugins, Models. Skill shares follow the official methodology — the
  session's usage at/after the skill's invocation counts toward it (shares
  overlap by design); trivial commands like /model and /clear are excluded.
  Full panel in the Content tab; a compact strip (≥5% lines only) on the
  Today tab.

- **AI advice transport** — speaks the **Anthropic** `/v1/messages` shape by
  default (`advice.apiFormat`), with the OpenAI chat-completions shape kept for
  DeepSeek and other compatible proxies. Timeout / retry / curl-fallback
  hardening across both. *(A keyless "subscription" backend — reuse the Claude
  Code OAuth session to call the API with no key — was prototyped and verified
  working via curl, but is NOT shipped: Anthropic returns 403 "Request not
  allowed" for that use of the OAuth token, so it's too fragile/inappropriate
  for a public extension. The transport stays dormant in advisor.ts to
  re-enable if direct calls become permitted.)*
- **AI advice fed with the new signals** — the advice prompt now includes
  the multi-agent runs (per-run cost, agent fan-out, cache hit rate per
  provider), the estimated thinking share and the usage-attribution panel
  (characteristics + top skills/subagents/plugins/models), so the model can
  give targeted advice instead of generic tips. New optional setting
  `claudeCodeUsage.advice.userContext`: free-text background about you/the
  project; when set, the advice ends with a "Personalised for this project"
  section calibrated against it. New `advice.promptWindowDays` (default 30)
  sets how many days of your own prompts and content the analysis samples.
- **AI advice card** at the top of the Content tab — the "Get AI advice"
  button now lives in a labelled card that says, in one line, what gets sent,
  instead of being tucked into the analysis header.
- **Usage Optimizer** (opt-in, `advice.optimizer.enabled`, default off) — a
  card on the Content tab where you paste a rough request and get back ONE
  tightened, paste-ready prompt plus a recommended reasoning effort / thinking
  / model for that task. Three optional lenses: flag ambiguous references,
  condense long pasted material, suggest a style direction. Runs through the
  same backend as AI advice; **only the text you paste is sent** (never your
  files or Claude Code's terminal), behind a one-time consent prompt.
- **Context-window indicator** in the status bar — shows the current
  session's context fill as a percentage (like `/context`), estimated from
  the latest log record (`input + cache read + cache write` tokens vs the
  model's window; `[1m]` long-context variants use 1M). Amber at 80%, red at
  95%. **Experimental, off by default** (`claudeCodeUsage.showContext`) — it can
  only show the input-side total, not `/context`'s category breakdown (those are
  Claude Code internals not on disk). A `~` marks a guessed window size;
  `contextWindowOverride` pins the real size for proxied/custom models. Reads
  the main-thread record (a running sub-agent no longer hijacks it) and stays
  visible across an overnight gap (24 h staleness guard). The tooltip shows a
  quota-style bar + the input-side composition.
  (Built on [PR #31](https://github.com/ClaudeCodeUsage/ClaudeCodeUsage/pull/31), @ScherbakovAl.)
- **`claudeCodeUsage.showCost` setting** — hide the status-bar cost item for
  those who only want the quota / context indicators (the dashboard still
  shows all cost figures). (PR #31, @ScherbakovAl.)
- **Authoritative skill / plugin attribution** — the Usage tracking panel now
  weights skills and plugins by the exact usage Claude Code stamps on each line
  (`attributionSkill` / `attributionPlugin`, ≥ CC 2.1) instead of the
  `<command-name>` heuristic, which it keeps only as a fallback for older logs.
- **Workflow main-session orchestration** — each run's drill-down now shows the
  main-thread spend that bracketed it (same session, within the run's window),
  so a native-Claude run whose expensive Opus/Fable orchestration lived in the
  main thread finally shows its true cost and models, not just the cheap
  sub-agent files. Heuristic (timestamp-bracketing, capped to focused windows).
- **Clearer run badges** — "workflow" (a dynamic-workflow run dir) vs
  "subagents (ad-hoc)" (a plain Task-tool fan-out), with a hint that the effort
  level itself is not recorded in the logs.
- **Per-model context-window sizes** in the status-bar context indicator
  (Opus 4.6+/Sonnet 4.6+/Fable 5 = 1M, Haiku/older Claude = 200K, DeepSeek =
  128K), and its tooltip is now a `/context`-style breakdown (fresh input /
  cache read / cache write / free space) with a tightened note. The Today
  "Usage tracking" card now shows only exact cost-weighted shares — the
  text-length thinking estimate was dropped from it (it remains on the
  Sessions tab, marked as an estimate). The Workflows tab gained a note
  explaining that native-Claude ultracode whose orchestration stays in the
  main session shows up in Sessions / Usage tracking rather than as a row.
- **Calibrated content analysis** — the Content tab can now anchor its
  per-category token figures to the *exact* billed totals (`analysis.calibrate`,
  default on): relative shares still come from text length, but the absolute
  numbers are scaled so assistant categories sum to real output tokens and
  user/tool-result categories to real input + cache-write tokens. This corrects
  a large undercount the text-length estimate had on the input side (cache
  creation is invisible to character counts). Sessions' Thinking column gains a
  calibrated "real thinking tokens" figure in its tooltip.

### Changed
- **Header trimmed** — the apple-style auto-refresh toggle moved into the ⚙
  Settings tab (a manual ↻ refresh still appears top-right when auto-refresh is
  paused). Two shortcut buttons remain: ✨ AI advice and ⚙ Settings, each
  jumping to its tab. The gear icon sits on the header button; the tab label
  drops it.
- **Usage Optimizer output is plain text** — the rewritten prompt is now
  returned without Markdown (no bold/headings/backticks/bullets) so it pastes
  cleanly into a terminal. Copy clearer, task-framed help; marked experimental.
- **AI advice + Optimizer cards redesigned** as a cohesive "action card"
  treatment (accent rail + icon badge), distinct from the data panels.

### Fixed
- **"Get AI Usage Advice" hanging or failing with `terminated`** — the
  request now has a 120 s timeout with a clear error, one retry, and a
  fallback to the system `curl` (the same transport of last resort the quota
  client uses); the prompt-sample payload is capped (40 prompts × 1500 chars).
- **Advice prompt samples polluted by agent traffic** — sub-agent logs,
  meta/sidechain lines and agent-framework scaffolding text are no longer
  harvested as "user prompts" for the advice feature.
- **Quota indicator blanked after switching folders in the same window** — the
  curl fallback now pins its working directory to the home dir (an inherited,
  now-invalid cwd made `spawn` fail with ENOENT), and a workspace-folders-change
  listener forces a fresh fetch — so the quota survives a folder switch without
  needing a new window.

## [2.0.2] — 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Claude Fable 5 / Mythos 5** pricing ($10 / $50, cache write $12.50,
  cache read $1 per MTok). Model ids with a `[1m]` long-context suffix are
  now resolved to their base pricing (also fixes proxy configs like
  `deepseek-v4-pro[1m]`).
- **Stacked cost-composition charts** on the Today (hourly), This-Month
  (daily) and All-Time (monthly) views, with a Y-axis and reference lines.
  Each cost bar splits into input / output / cache-write / cache-read; the
  metric switcher still renders single bars for token / message metrics.
- **Sessions tab "Session" column** — the conversation title (the name
  `claude --resume` shows), sortable, so same-project sessions are
  distinguishable.
- Dashboard **auto-refresh toggle** had already landed in 2.0.1; this release
  refines its surrounding behaviour.

### Fixed
- **Quota indicator stale / stuck after reset** — an expired window now shows
  0% (rolled forward to the new period) and is refetched, instead of lingering
  on a stale value or vanishing. Adapted from
  [PR #24](https://github.com/ClaudeCodeUsage/ClaudeCodeUsage/pull/24) by
  [@nickearnshaw](https://github.com/nickearnshaw).
- **Quota "only comes back after I restart VS Code"** — an expired in-memory
  OAuth token now triggers a re-read of `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (which
  Claude Code keeps refreshing) before our own refresh; the 429 cool-down was
  cut from 5 minutes to 60 s; and the `/usage` fetch cadence was made gentler
  (60 s active / 120 s idle) so rate-limiting is rare.
- **Usage not showing the first time you open VS Code** — the status bar now
  shows a loading state immediately and the quota fetch is non-blocking, so
  local cost figures appear at once and the quota follows.
  ([#26](https://github.com/ClaudeCodeUsage/ClaudeCodeUsage/issues/26))
- **"This project" figure undercounted / disappeared** — per-conversation
  attribution now keys off the session's home project directory instead of the
  per-record working directory (which wanders mid-session), and the figure is
  shown even at $0 instead of vanishing through the day.
- **Message count** now counts messages you actually typed, excluding API
  calls, command echoes (`/model` …) and interruption markers (a session that
  read 106 now reads ~86). Token figures are unchanged.
- **Per-metric chart Y-axis** now updates when switching metric (it was stuck
  on the cost units).
- **Activity-aware refresh** (≈8 s while Claude Code is writing, the user's
  interval when idle) with coalesced triggers, so high-consumption ultracode /
  Fable 5 runs update promptly without starving on rapid sub-agent writes.
- **Sub-agent / workflow log attribution** — records under
  `subagents/workflows/…` resolve to their parent session and real project
  (were fragmenting into `wf_*` / `agent-*` pseudo-entries).
- Drill-down charts: removed a double scrollbar; date labels parse the date
  textually (UTC parsing shifted labels a day in negative-UTC timezones).
- `launch.json` `preLaunchTask` fixed so F5 works in a single-root checkout
  ([PR #22](https://github.com/ClaudeCodeUsage/ClaudeCodeUsage/pull/22), @nickearnshaw).

### Docs / project
- Refreshed all language READMEs to v2 (en / zh-TW / ja / ko concise; zh-CN
  full translation); fixed the `CHANGELOG.md` link casing.
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md`, a PR template, and issue templates; documented
  `cleanupPeriodDays` for history retention
  ([PR #21](https://github.com/ClaudeCodeUsage/ClaudeCodeUsage/pull/21), @nickearnshaw).
- Loading-spinner / re-entrancy guard for the webview
  ([PR #20](https://github.com/ClaudeCodeUsage/ClaudeCodeUsage/pull/20), @nickearnshaw).
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` to the v2 architecture and release process.

## [2.0.1] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Dashboard "Auto-refresh" toggle** — iOS-style slider in the header
  pauses automatic webview updates while the status bar continues live.
  The "Refresh Now" button appears when auto-refresh is off. State persists
  via `claudeCodeUsage.pauseDashboardRefresh` setting. Addresses
  issue #17 follow-up (constantly-reloading dashboard during agent work).
- **`claudeCodeUsage.fileWatching` setting** — disables `fs.watch`-based
  real-time refresh for users who prefer the calmer interval-only mode.
- **Diagnostic output channel** — `Claude Code Usage: Show Diagnostic Logs`
  now logs per-refresh stats: files scanned, records kept/replaced/skipped,
  rejection reasons, and per-model record counts with token sums. Useful
  for diagnosing under-reported usage with third-party proxies.

### Fixed
- **Dedup kept the wrong record** (issue #18, reported by @zhaoxiao9302):
  proxies such as mimo / CC Switch write a `tokens=0` placeholder first
  and then a second record with real values sharing the same `messageId`.
  The dedup now keeps whichever record has the higher total token sum
  instead of always keeping the first.
- **DeepSeek pricing wrong** — `deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner`
  were priced at V4-Flash rates ($0.14/$0.28); corrected to V4-Pro
  ($0.435/$0.87, cache hit $0.003625). Added explicit `deepseek-v4-pro`
  entry. Family fallback now also resolves to Pro tier.
- **Quota indicator hidden in workspaces without local data** — quota is
  account-level; it now refreshes unconditionally and is no longer hidden
  when the workspace has no Claude history or the data directory cannot
  be found.
- **Webview / status bar stuck on "Loading…"** (PR #20, @nickearnshaw):
  added re-entrancy guard so overlapping refresh triggers coalesce instead
  of piling up. Spinner now only shows on cold start (no data yet);
  background refreshes keep the existing dashboard visible.
- **Log timestamps were UTC** — diagnostic output channel now shows the
  user's local time.

### Added (models)
- **Opus 4.8** added to the pricing table (same tier as 4.7/4.6/4.5).

### Changed
- Quota fetch cache: 2 min (v2.0.0) → 120 s (unchanged value, restored
  from an intermediate 30 s that was too chatty).
- Validator relaxed: only `timestamp` and numeric `input_tokens` /
  `output_tokens` are required; secondary fields with unexpected types
  are accepted rather than causing the whole record to be dropped.
- `claudeCodeUsage.advice.apiKey` no longer falls back to the pre-2.0
  flat `adviceApiKey` key (fixes demo-mode never triggering).

### Docs
- README intro replaced with "The Claude Code coach in your status bar"
  positioning (EN + 中文 + ja + ko + zh-TW slogan updated).
- New Troubleshooting entries: missing history (→ `cleanupPeriodDays`),
  token counts lower than provider dashboard (→ sub-agent note).
  Thanks @nickearnshaw (PR #21) for the `cleanupPeriodDays` docs.

### Dev
- `launch.json` `preLaunchTask` fixed so F5 works in a single-root
  checkout (PR #22, @nickearnshaw).

## [2.0.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added

#### Pricing accuracy
- **Opus 4.6 / 4.7 / Sonnet 4.5 / Sonnet 4.6 / Haiku 4.5** added to the pricing
  table (verified against the official Anthropic pricing page).
- Reference pricing for common non-Anthropic models that may appear in proxied
  Claude Code setups: **OpenAI** (GPT-5.x, 4.1.x, 4o, o3, o4-mini), **Google
  Gemini** (2.5 Pro/Flash, 2.0 Flash), **DeepSeek** (chat / reasoner /
  v4-flash), **Moonshot Kimi** (K2.5 / K2.6), **Zhipu GLM** (4.5 / 4.6) and
  **Alibaba Qwen** (Max / Plus / Turbo / Long).
- **Family-aware pricing fallback**: unknown model snapshots are now priced
  against the current tier of their detected family (Opus / Sonnet / Haiku /
  GPT / Gemini / DeepSeek / Kimi / GLM / Qwen) instead of always falling back
  to Sonnet 4.
- **Per-model rates** displayed inline in the model breakdown section.
- **`Refresh Model Pricing`** command + button pulls live prices from
  LiteLLM's public dataset as runtime overrides.

#### Quota tracking (real `/usage` data)
- **5-hour and weekly limit utilisation** + reset times fetched via Claude
  Code's own OAuth session at `~/.claude/.credentials.json` →
  `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`. Zero configuration. _Approach adapted
  from upstream [PR #9](https://github.com/ClaudeCodeUsage/ClaudeCodeUsage/pull/9) by
  [@Dobidop](https://github.com/Dobidop)._
- Dedicated, quieter status-bar item shows `5h:N% wk:N%`; warns yellow at
  ≥80%, red at ≥95%.
- Tooltip is a Markdown table with utilisation, reset countdown and weekly
  reset weekday/time.

#### Usage insights
- **Sessions tab** — usage per conversation (one row per `.jsonl` file), with
  project, peak context window, duration and a session-id tooltip. Sortable.
- **Projects tab** — usage aggregated per working directory. Paths that differ
  only in case are merged. Projects are grouped (configurably) by their
  enclosing git repository with sub-folder drill-down. Sortable.
- **Content tab** — estimated breakdown of which conversation content consumes
  tokens (your prompts vs. tool results by tool vs. assistant output /
  thinking), scoped to the last 30 days.
- **Branches tab** — usage aggregated per git branch.
- **Stacked token-composition chart** on the daily / monthly / hourly views,
  with Y-axis and reference lines.
- **Today's hourly chart** now has a Y-axis, two dashed reference lines and a
  value label on every bar; tooltip no longer repeats the hour.
- **Cost composition** in the usage summary: how much of the cost comes from
  input / output / cache-write / cache-read tokens.
- **Cache hit rate** metric in the usage summary.
- **Peak context** column on the Sessions tab, mirroring what `/context`
  reports for a single request.

#### AI advice (opt-in)
- **`Get AI Usage Advice`** command + button. Sends an aggregate summary
  plus a sample of your recent user prompts (or just the aggregates if
  prompts are unavailable) to an OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint
  (DeepSeek V4 Pro by default, `reasoning_effort=max`) and opens the
  optimisation advice as a Markdown document.
- **Scope picker**: overall, or one specific project.
- Output filename is `claude-advice-<scope>-YYYY-MM-DD_HHmm.md`.
- Advice model is instructed to reply in the user's UI language.
- **Demo-mode fallback**: if no API key is configured, the command offers
  a `Preview demo` option that opens a static example of what real advice
  looks like — so users can decide whether to set up a key before
  configuring one. The demo file is filename-marked `…-DEMO-…`, opens
  with a prominent banner ("This file is a static demo, not real advice"
  + 4 enable steps), and the body is **localised per UI language**
  (en / zh-CN / zh-TW / ja / ko / de-DE) so users can judge the feature
  in their own language.

#### Quality-of-life
- **Status-bar tooltip** is now an aligned Markdown table.
- Status bar also shows the **current-session cost** next to today's cost.
- **Compact number format** option (`1.2M` / `345K`).
- **Reading-friendly timestamps** ("Today HH:MM", "Yesterday HH:MM",
  "MM-DD HH:MM", "YYYY-MM-DD").
- **Sortable columns** on Sessions / Projects / Branches tabs.
- **`Refresh Model Pricing`** + `Get AI Usage Advice` commands in the
  Command Palette.

#### Settings (all opt-in)
- `enableContentAnalysis` — toggle the Content tab + analysis pipeline.
- `projectGroupingMode` — `git` (default), `folder` (no fs walk) or `flat`.
- `compactNumbers` — toggle `1.2M`/`345K` formatting.
- `usageLimitTracking` — enable/disable the OAuth quota indicator.
- `adviceApiKey` / `adviceApiUrl` / `adviceModel` / `adviceReasoningEffort` —
  AI advice configuration.

### Changed

- **`advice.apiKey` is no longer back-compat read from the pre-2.0
  `adviceApiKey` flat key.** Other `advice.*` config still falls back so
  URL / model / effort survive the rename. Reason: with the apiKey
  fallback, clearing the *new* key in Settings did not actually disable
  the feature (the old key kept it alive silently and the demo-mode
  fallback never triggered). Migration: if you set `adviceApiKey`
  before 2.0, re-paste it under **`claudeCodeUsage.advice.apiKey`**.
- **OAuth usage API calls now go through the system `curl` binary** instead
  of Node's `fetch` / `https`. Reason: Anthropic's edge now rejects
  requests whose TLS ClientHello (JA3/JA4) does not match a real CLI
  client — Node's openssl handshake gets `403 "Request not allowed"` from
  both the usage and token-refresh endpoints, while the same bearer token
  works fine through `curl`. `curl.exe` ships with Windows 10+ (2018) and
  is universally available on macOS / Linux, so this is portable. If
  `curl` is missing the quota indicator just stays hidden, like before.

### Fixed

- **Opus 4.5** 5-minute cache-write rate: was `$6.00 / MTok`, corrected to
  `$6.25 / MTok` (= 1.25× the input rate).
- **Haiku 3.5** 5-minute cache-write rate: was `$1.60 / MTok` (that's the
  1-hour rate), corrected to `$1.00 / MTok`.
- `claudeCodeUsage.decimalPlaces` setting was ignored by `formatCurrency` —
  now respected throughout the UI.
- Cache metrics renamed to **"Input Cache (Miss/Hit)"** for clarity.
- **Hard-coded Traditional Chinese strings** in the drill-down views
  (`renderHourlyData`, `renderDailyData`, `renderDailyChart`) replaced with
  proper i18n — non-zh-TW users no longer see Chinese in the daily/hourly
  detail panels. Affected closing upstream **PR #8** in spirit.
- **Light theme tab visibility**: tab labels inherited a white foreground
  on light themes and became unreadable. Fixed by setting an explicit
  `color: var(--vscode-foreground)` on `.tab`. **Closes upstream #11.**
- All `toLocaleString` / `toLocaleDateString` calls now pass the user's
  selected locale explicitly, so thousands-separators and date order match
  the UI language (German `.`, English `,`, etc.). Aligned with upstream
  **PR #8**'s locale-aware approach.

### Personalisation

- `enableContentAnalysis` (default true) — toggle the Content tab + analysis pipeline.
- `projectGroupingMode` — `git` (default), `folder` (no fs walk) or `flat`.
- `timezone` — IANA timezone name for date display (e.g. `Asia/Hong_Kong`,
  `UTC`). Useful inside sandboxes / devcontainers whose system timezone
  doesn't match the user's actual zone. **Closes upstream #10.**
- `compactNumbers` — toggle `1.2M`/`345K` formatting.
- `usageLimitTracking` — enable/disable the OAuth quota indicator.
- `adviceApiKey` / `adviceApiUrl` / `adviceModel` / `adviceReasoningEffort` —
  AI advice configuration.

### Issues closed by this release

- **#7** Phantom `ccusageIntegration.js` in published `.vsix` — this release
  is built from clean source; the file does not exist. `.claude/**` and
  `.github/**` added to `.vscodeignore` as a belt-and-braces measure.
- **#10** Preferred timezone configuration — see `timezone` setting above.
- **#11** Display anomaly under light theme — fixed.
- **#13** "Feature request: % used" — fulfilled by the real OAuth quota
  indicator described above.

### Performance & stability

- **Idle-aware refresh**: when no log file has changed since the last load,
  the refresh skips the recompute and only updates the (independent) quota
  indicator. Idle ticks now do near-zero work.
- **Non-blocking refresh**: the loader yields to the event loop every 25
  files so a large history no longer freezes the extension host (and the
  Claude Code extension that shares it).
- Refresh uses an `mtime`-based check instead of a fixed 1-minute cache age.
